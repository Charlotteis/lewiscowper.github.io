<h3>Technical Skills</h3>

  <p> JavaScript, AngularJS, Node.js, HTML5, Less, CSS3, Jasmine, Karma, npm, Grunt, Gulp.</p>

<h3>Areas of Interest</h3>

  <p>Offline First, P2P, WebRTC, Service Worker, API Driven Design, Open Source.</p>

<h3>Programming Projects</h3>

  <h4>
    <a href="https://lewiscowper.github.io/serviceworker-demo/">Service Worker Demo</a>
  </h4>
  <p>When I thought about extending my lightning talk on ServiceWorker, I really liked the idea of actually using a Service Worker, so I wrote an application that renders London Underground and DLR stations on a map, and tells the user about any disruption on the network.</p>

  <h4>
    <a href="http://hood.ie">Hoodie</a>
  </h4>
  <p>I'm a Hoodie <a href="http://hood.ie/community">community member</a>, and thoroughly enjoy contributing to the Hoodie Open Source project, as it gives me a chance to tackle more Javascript and Node.js, and use a real life project to learn build tools like Grunt, and packaging projects for npm. Hoodie is a Javascript framework that takes care of the backend for you, so entire apps can be written in frontend code. This means that Hoodie is fantastic for prototyping apps, but it also has a killer feature. Hoodie is one of a growing number of methods to handle the Offline First design pattern. This means that data is processed asynchronously, when a connection to a remote database is present, however the interruption to the user is non existent, as the app stores data locally.</p>

  <h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/lewiscowper/swapi-scheme">Star Wars API Wrapper</a>
  </h4>
  <p>I created an API wrapper in Chicken Scheme for the Star Wars API. This API takes REST requests, and I really wanted an excuse to use Scheme for something, and learned enough to try my hand at a Lisp based language, the day after learning anything about Scheme. I really enjoy the simplicity/complexity combination with Lisp, where nothing is more complex than (function arg1 arg2), but the power of passing functions into functions is brilliance.</p>

  <h4>Local Usergroups</h4>
  <p>I attend a large number of usergroups, including PySheff (Python Sheffield), Sheffield.js (Javascript), def shef (Functional Programming), First Play Sheffield (Video games general), ORGSheff (Open Rights Group Sheffield), and use these as learning opportunities, and also to network among developers in the local area.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

  <h4>WANdisco - Jr UX Engineer - <i>(Sep 2014 - Present)</i></h4>
  <p>I am in charge of UX/UI design and implementation for our Access Control Plus application. I also take part in the design of new products, and new features in existing products. For me it's important that our products have the simplest user flow, without losing any functionality. I'm also involved in the implementation of those interfaces, often trusted to go from service through to the view. We use AngularJS, which is a really good fit for our workflow and requirements, and we use Grunt as our build tool.</p>

  <h4>WANdisco - Jr Test Engineer - <i>(Jan 2014 - Aug 2014)</i></h4>
  <p>I performed regression testing across WANdisco's ALM product line, and often more targeted testing around diagnosing a specific issue. As such, I was expected to have a working knowledge of Git and SVN usage across a command line interface or via various GUI packages. I set up numerous Linux virtual machines to test our software on, and administered the tests either via the UI of the product, or across a remote shell session. I also created and maintained test cases via Gurock TestRail, and am familiar with the Jenkins Continuous Integration server. If a regression did occur, I used Jira to raise issues, and I was also confident using Atlassian's Confluence to find and write internal documentation.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

  <h4>
    <b>Open University </b><i>(Jan 2012 - Aug 2013)</i>
  </h4>
  <span>Certificate in Computing & IT </span><i>(Awarded December 2012)</i>
  <p>I gained a broad knowledge of IT and computing technologies that affect everybody. I also gained practical experience developing and programming ubiquitous computing devices.</p>
  <p>Modules completed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My Digital Life</li>
    <li>Design Thinking: Creativity for the 21st Century</li>
